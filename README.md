# Multi-class Image Classification of Dog Breeds
### This project was done as part of the coursework for CS 6140: Machine Learning

Identifying a large number of species as a human is a difficult task. Though we find it easier to differentiate between two different breeds, it is challenging to identify, differentiate and remember every existing species. Dogs are among the foremost common pets, thus a dog breed recognition program can be useful in multiple real-world scenarios.
